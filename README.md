# Frontend

This project is the frontend part of the Fullstack-Test application. It is built using React and communicates with a backend to fetch and display data.

## How to Start the Project

To start the local server for the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```Bash
npm install
```
4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. The project should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:5001. If it does not open automatically, manually enter the URL in your browser.

## Utility Scripts

### create-component.js

The `create-component.js` script is a utility tool designed to streamline the creation of new React components within the project. By running this script, developers can quickly generate the necessary files and boilerplate code for a new component, ensuring consistency and saving time during development.

- Navigate to the frontend project directory in your console to use it.

### Example Commands

```bash
  npm run cc name path
```

### Description:

- name: The simple name of the component. The script automatically appends the suffix Component. For example, if you provide 'ABC', it will create ABC folder, ABCComponent.tsx, ABCComponent.css.

- path (optional): Specifies the path where the component should be created, e.g., ./src/components. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. If no path is provided, the component will be created in the default path shown in the console.
